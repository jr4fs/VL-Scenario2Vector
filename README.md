## Problem Description
We propose Scenario2Vector - a Scenario Description  Language  (SDL)  based  embedding  for  traffic situations that allows us to automatically search for similar traffic situations from the large data-sets obtained from different AVs
- Input: traffic scenario (i.e lane change) 
- Output: A similar traffic scenario (semantically and temporally) in a different dataset, standard metric of comparison
